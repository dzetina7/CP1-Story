This weeked i plan to have a good timne with my family.
It is my birthday this Saturday, June 1st.
I want to have a lot of fun with my family and friends.
I hope i get showered with love and that i am happy for the whole day.
I really wish my family could get me my dream dog, a labrodoodle 
I want to make some memories and take some pictures that i will remember forever 
i  am really grateful for my family and friends and for everything they do for me.
I cant wait to get my license as i am turning 16
i cant believe that I will be moving on to my junior year of highschool.
My junior year is going to be the most stressful for me.
I want my parents to know that i love them and that I am grateful.
